# VexyFormi Refactoring Plan

## Project Overview and Objectives

**Core Mission**: Transform the external/minify "unimini" tool into a modern, efficient `vfor` CLI and `vexy-formi` Python package optimized for fast code formatting and minification operations.

### Problem Analysis
- **Current State**: The unimini tool is a comprehensive but over-engineered solution with enterprise-grade features that may be excessive for a simple utility
- **Target State**: Clean, fast, elegant tool that prioritizes speed and simplicity while maintaining core functionality
- **Key Challenge**: Strip enterprise bloat while preserving the valuable fast tool integration and safety mechanisms

### Constraints and Requirements
- **Speed Priority**: Must maintain or exceed current performance characteristics
- **Simplicity First**: Avoid enterprise features unless explicitly necessary
- **Python Package**: Must work as both CLI tool and importable library
- **Tool Compatibility**: Preserve integration with fast tools (esbuild, swc, biome, ruff, etc.)
- **Safety**: Maintain basic safety features but simplify implementation

## Solution Architecture

### Scope Definition (One Sentence)
Create a fast code formatting and minification CLI tool with Python package support that uses the fastest available tools while maintaining basic safety and simplicity.

### Core Components Structure

```
vexy-formi/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/vexy_formi/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py           # Package interface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core.py              # Core formatting/minification logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tools.py             # Tool detection and execution
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ files.py             # File operations and validation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cli.py               # CLI interface
â”œâ”€â”€ vfor                     # CLI script (symlinks to python -m vexy_formi)
â””â”€â”€ tests/                   # Test suite
```

## ðŸ”§ NEW QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS (Round 2)

Based on analysis of current project state (16/16 tests passing, all core functionality working), here are 3 targeted improvements to enhance performance, reliability, and user experience:

### Task 4: Performance Optimization and Caching
**Goal**: Improve tool detection performance and reduce startup time

**Current Issue**: Tool availability is detected on every run, causing slower startup
**Target**: Cache tool detection results and optimize hot paths

**Specific Tasks**:
- Add intelligent tool availability caching with cache invalidation
- Optimize file discovery algorithms for large directory trees
- Add lazy loading for rarely-used tools
- Benchmark and optimize batch processing performance
- Add progress indicators for long-running operations

### Task 5: Enhanced Error Recovery and Resilience
**Goal**: Improve robustness when dealing with edge cases and system issues

**Current Issue**: Some edge cases could be handled more gracefully
**Target**: Better recovery from common failure scenarios

**Specific Tasks**:
- Add better handling for permission errors with actionable suggestions
- Implement graceful degradation when tools are partially broken
- Add retry logic for transient filesystem errors
- Improve error context with file paths and specific failure reasons  
- Add validation for corrupted or locked files

### Task 6: User Experience and Workflow Enhancement
**Goal**: Make the tool more intuitive and helpful for daily use

**Current Issue**: Good functionality but could be more user-friendly
**Target**: Enhanced usability for common developer workflows

**Specific Tasks**:
- Add dry-run mode to preview changes before applying
- Improve progress reporting with estimated time remaining
- Add file count and size summaries in output
- Add support for .gitignore-style exclusion patterns
- Add warning for potentially destructive operations on large codebases
