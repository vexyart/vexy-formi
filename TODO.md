## âœ… COMPLETED TASKS (Round 2 Completion) - ALL DONE!

### âœ… Task 7: Performance Analysis and Optimization (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Measure and optimize batch processing performance

- âœ… Add benchmarking tools for batch processing operations (already existed - comprehensive system)
- âœ… Measure processing speed across different file types and sizes (tested across JS/CSS/Python)
- âœ… Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks (added lazy validation, analyzed overhead)
- âœ… Add performance regression detection (complete system with baselines and CLI command)

### âœ… Task 8: Enhanced File Validation and Safety (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Improve safety when processing edge-case files

- âœ… Add validation for corrupted or locked files

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT PHASE: Quality Polish & Reliability Enhancement

### Task 10: Test Coverage Expansion and Reliability
**Goal**: Strengthen test coverage for edge cases and new features added in recent updates

**Rationale**: The recent additions (safety system, performance tracking, file validation fixes) need comprehensive test coverage to ensure long-term reliability and prevent regressions.

**Specific Tasks**:
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for safety system (SafetyChecker, thresholds, confirmations)
- [ ] Add tests for performance regression detection (PerformanceTracker, baselines)  
- [ ] Add tests for fixed file validation methods (integrity, lock status, encoding checks)
- [ ] Add integration tests for --force and --dry-run flags with safety system
- [ ] Add edge case tests for large file handling and memory efficiency

### Task 11: Error Recovery and Resilience Enhancement  
**Goal**: Improve robustness of error handling and recovery in complex failure scenarios

**Rationale**: While basic error handling exists, complex scenarios (network issues, disk full, interrupted operations) could benefit from more sophisticated recovery mechanisms.

**Specific Tasks**:
- [ ] Add intelligent retry logic for tool execution failures (distinguish transient vs permanent)
- [ ] Implement graceful handling of disk space exhaustion during backup creation
- [ ] Add recovery mechanisms for interrupted batch operations (resume capability)
- [ ] Enhance tool cache invalidation when tools are updated/changed
- [ ] Add better handling for concurrent file access conflicts

### Task 12: Configuration and Usability Refinements
**Goal**: Polish configuration management and improve daily-use ergonomics  

**Rationale**: Small usability improvements can significantly enhance developer experience and reduce friction in daily workflows.

**Specific Tasks**:
- [ ] Add configuration validation and helpful error messages for .vfor.json
- [ ] Implement smart defaults based on project type detection (package.json, pyproject.toml presence)
- [ ] Add --config flag to specify custom config file locations
- [ ] Implement configuration inheritance (global â†’ project â†’ command-line)
- [ ] Add configuration documentation generation (vfor config --help)
